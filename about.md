### **ACM** is short for **Association for Computing Machinery**, and is a worldwide professional organization for **computer scientists** and others in **computing-related disciplines**.

### Here at **UCSC**, we have a student **ACM** chapter, which seeks to **promote** interest in **computer science** and other **science- and engineering-related** disciplines.

### We aim to provide **a strong sense of community** to all **engineering** students within the Baskin School of Engineering, with a particular focus on students studying **computer science**. We host events such as **tech talks**, **code-a-thons**, **movie nights**, **game nights**, and **Friday socials**. Some additional types of events which we plan to host in the near future include **scavenger hunts** and **programming contests**.
