Hey ACM,

Thank you for those who applied to become the new Secretary. We decided to actually open up one more position: Fundraising Officer. The new Secretary is **Jesse Chan**, and the new Fundraising Officer is **Nimesh Poudel**.

**Of course, ACM's direction is not entirely led by the officers. It is led by everyone involved in the club, so please bring your suggestions to the meetings and talk about them with your friends and let us know about them.**

Tomorrow's meeting is at **4:00-5:00pm at E2 599**. We'll be talking about internship experiences, presenting coding questions, and presenting a Hackathon guide.
