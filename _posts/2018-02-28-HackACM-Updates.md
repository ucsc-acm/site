**Sponsors**

I am very excited to announce our sponsors!

HackACM wouldn't be as exciting as it is without the help of:

**Our Campus Sponsors**:

College 10 Senate

Crown Student Senate

Student Union Assembly


**Our Corporate Sponsors**:

RAVV <https://www.ravv.com/>

Amazon Alexa <https://developer.amazon.com/alexa>

StdLib <https://stdlib.com/>

We are very excited to be supported by them!

**Prize Categories**

As HackACM is a hackathon for students, by students, we are hoping to see some cool hacks that help students in any way possible. Two of our sponsors have their own categories: Amazon Alexa and StdLib. And of course, the top three best hacks will also win prizes!

We also have a surprise category that we will announce at the beginning of
HackACM!

**So the prize category list is:**

First Place Overall

Second Place Overall

Third Place Overall

Help a Slug

Sponsor prizes:
    Amazon Alexa
    StdLib

Surprise category

Outside of hacks, there is a raffle that you can join, we will be giving
tickets out at the beginning.

Given this, there are many opportunities for teams to win! Make sure to
start thinking about an idea to work on!

**Things to Bring**

Your laptop and charger

We have outlets, but just to be safe if you have an extension cord, you should bring that.

A project idea (or a beginning of one, you will have time to think of one)

Food and snacks will be provided but if you want to bring your own, you are more than welcome to.

**Arrival/Sign in**

HackACM is on **March 3rd, 2018** and doors open at **9:00 AM**. Our main venue is the **room 180 in the Baskin Engineering 2** building (also called the simularium).

The entrance is on the the outside, on the bottom floor, and on the right hand side of the building. We will have our banner displayed so you will know if you are in the right place. You will be asked to sign in at the door. Once you go in, you can get situated and wait for the opening ceremonies. We will have more spaces/rooms where you can work. Those spaces will be announced at the beginning as well.

Once again, the schedule is displayed here <https://goo.gl/KuTWBc>.

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate emailing acm@ucsc.edu

There's less than a week left! Get excited; get ready; it's almost hacking
time!

I hope to see you all there!
